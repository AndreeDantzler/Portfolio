# Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my Portfolio!

I was tasked with following the below Acceptance Criteria to create a portfolio which would allow me to apply the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
This Portfolio has been enhanced to showcase some work that I have done so far. This updated portfolio is featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
